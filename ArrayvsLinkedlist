#ArrayVsLinkedList
Arrays contain elements with similar data type.
Linkedlist contains group of objects called nodes with two fields: data and address

In arrays, memory allocation is at compile time.
In Linkedlist, memmory allocation is at runtime.

An array stores elements in a contiguous memory location.
Linkedlist stores elements randomly at any memory address.

In arrays, memory size is fixed at declaration; it cannot be altered at runtime.
In linkedlist, memory size is dynamic i.e. it can be altered at runtime.

In arrays, elemts are not dependent on each other.
Im linkedlist, elements are dependent on each other as every node stores the address of the next.
